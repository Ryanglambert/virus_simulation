# virus_simulation
a stochastic simulation from edx.org

The two files you want to use are ps3b.py and ps4.py 
unfortunately I've still got some fixing to do on the classes "resistant virus" and "treated patient".  In the interest of time I moved on to the analytical components of the project and opted to use edx's precompiled montecarlo simulation. 

to configure files for different populations / prescription times edit the following entries

ps3b.py 

566     timeSteps = 450
567     timeAddPrescription = 0
568     timeAddPrescription2 = 150
569     firstPrescription = "grimpex"    ### the name doesn't matter
570     secondPrescription = "guttaganol"  ### the name doesn't matter
571     maxPop = 1000
572     numTrials = 100


ps4.py

 96 ### input treatment times here
 97     treatmentTime = 150
 98     treatmentTime2 = 150
 99 ## input no. of trials and pick simulation here:
100     finalPopulation = simulationTwoDrugsDelayedTreatment(
101             numTrials=100
102             )


dependencies: numpy, matplotlib,
